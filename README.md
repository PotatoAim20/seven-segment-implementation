# 7-Segment Display Arduino Code and Simulation in Proteus

## Overview
This repository includes Arduino code for controlling a 7-segment display and a simulation setup using Proteus. The code demonstrates how to interface with a common cathode 7-segment display, display numbers, and create a simple count-up sequence. The Proteus simulation provides a virtual environment to visualize the behavior of the Arduino code.

## Key Features
1. **Arduino Code:**
   - Implements a basic 7-segment display control system.
   - Displays numbers from 0 to 9 in a count-up sequence.
   - Easily customizable for other applications.

2. **Proteus Simulation:**
   - Includes the Proteus simulation setup for testing the Arduino code virtually.
   - Enables users to observe the behavior of the 7-segment display in a simulated environment.

## Files in the Repository
- **arduino_code.ino:**
  - Arduino code for the 7-segment display.

- **proteus_simulation.pdsprj:**
  - Proteus project file containing the simulation setup.
